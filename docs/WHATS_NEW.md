# What's New — Sarke 2.0 Changelog

**Updated:** 2026-05-27 | Branch: `main`

## 2026-05-27 — Web-app: architectural refactor — native inputs (complete), AsyncBoundary isolation, store rename

- **Native Input/Textarea complete migration**: All Mantine `TextInput` and `Textarea` usages across the web-app replaced with native Tailwind-only `<Input>`/`<Textarea>` components. Migrated ~35 files covering auth pages, project detail sections, inspection detail/wizard, equipment detail pages, briefing/incident/report detail pages, and shared components (FieldInput, ChecklistItemRow, InspectionSignatures, HarnessChecklist, InspectionInfoView). Mantine is kept only for UI components (Modal, NumberInput, PasswordInput, Badge, Card, etc.).
- **NewOrder extracted to feature module**: `NewOrder` component moved from a page-level file to `features/orders/components/NewOrder/` in line with the feature-sliced architecture; route file is now a thin orchestrator.
- **Data layer `Tables<T>` type aliases**: All `lib/data/` modules now export `Tables<T>` type aliases for their DB row types, making query return types explicit and reducing `any` casts across the data layer.
- **AsyncBoundary applied to all ProjectDetail sections**: All 10 data-fetching sections in `src/pages/ProjectDetail/index.tsx` (`ProjectDetailsCard`, `CrewSection`, `SignersSection`, `InspectionsSection`, `IncidentsSection`, `BriefingsSection`, `ReportsSection`, `FilesSection`, `OrdersSection`, `DangerZoneSection`) are now each wrapped in `<AsyncBoundary>`. A section-level render error now shows an inline red banner for that section only instead of blanking the entire page. `AsyncBoundary` extended to support a no-query shell mode backed by a `SectionErrorBoundary` class component.
- **`useSafetyStore` renamed from `useAppStore`**: The Zustand 3D safety viewer store in `src/store/safetyStore.ts` is now exported as `useSafetyStore`. All consumers updated: `Scene3D.tsx`, `SidePanel.tsx`, `ConstructionModel.tsx`, `useSafetySelectors.ts`, and all affected test files. Zero `useAppStore` references remain in `src/`.

## 2026-05-27 — Mobile: unified inspection-start flow + CustomDropdown reuses canonical BottomSheet

### 🔴 BUG-23 — non-equipment templates froze the app after the template picker closed ([app/(tabs)/home.tsx](../app/(tabs)/home.tsx), [components/ui/CustomDropdown.tsx](../components/ui/CustomDropdown.tsx))

Picking `ფასადის ხარაჩო`, `დამცავი ქამრები`, or any non-equipment template from the home dropdown left the app stuck on home — the bottom sheet closed but no navigation happened. Two compounding bugs:

1. `CustomDropdown` rolled its own RN `<Modal>` (radius 20, no shadow, no gesture dismiss) instead of using the canonical `BottomSheet` from `components/BottomSheet.tsx`. Visually inconsistent with every other action sheet (radius 24, spring entrance, swipe-down dismiss).
2. The non-equipment branch then opened a **second** `BottomSheet` via `ProjectPickerSheet` for project selection. `BottomSheet`'s global `isSheetOpen` guard silently no-ops a second sheet while the first is still animating closed (~220 ms). Result: second sheet never opens, app appears frozen.

**Fix:**

- `CustomDropdown` now delegates its sheet to `useBottomSheet()` — all three call sites (`home.tsx`, `more.tsx`, `features/project-detail`) get the same rounded corners, shadow, spring entrance, haptic, and gesture dismiss. `onChange` fires synchronously from the `Pressable.onPress` so `router.push` runs in a normal React event tick (firing it from the BottomSheet animation-finish callback is dropped on the floor by expo-router on iOS — that was the actual freeze, after the sheet had closed).
- Removed the `DEFERRED_PROJECT_CATEGORIES` branch in `home.tsx`. **Every** template — equipment or not — now navigates to `/inspections/new?category=…&templateId=…` and picks its project as step 0 inside the wizard. No more nested sheets.
- `app/inspections/new.tsx` extended to handle all template categories: dispatches through `inspectionRegistry` for equipment, falls back to `questionnairesApi.create` for generic templates (xaracho, mobile_scaffold, harness, …). Title derived from the template name via `inspectionDisplayName`. The early `router.back()` guard moved inside a `useEffect` so it can't infinite-loop during render if `useLocalSearchParams` is briefly undefined.
- `ProjectPickerSheet` retained for incident/briefing/report quick actions and the new-project inline flow (where it still works because it's the only sheet open).

**Tests:** [tests/unit/CustomDropdown.test.tsx](../tests/unit/CustomDropdown.test.tsx) — 16 cases covering trigger rendering, sheet content, synchronous-onChange invariant (the bug-fix lock-in), cancel-without-onChange, controlled mode, and per-option dispatch. Uses `@testing-library/react` against the `react-native-web` alias.

**Files:**
- [components/ui/CustomDropdown.tsx](../components/ui/CustomDropdown.tsx) — full rewrite, delegates to canonical sheet
- [app/(tabs)/home.tsx](../app/(tabs)/home.tsx) — template `onChange` always pushes to `/inspections/new`; single-template quick action does the same; dead `pickerPreselectedTemplateId` state removed
- [app/inspections/new.tsx](../app/inspections/new.tsx) — category-agnostic, registry-or-generic dispatch
- [tests/unit/CustomDropdown.test.tsx](../tests/unit/CustomDropdown.test.tsx) — new

## 2026-05-26 — Web-app: ghost-page DOM accumulation fixed + scaffold badge + dropdown cleanup

### 🔴 BUG-20 — every navigation leaked a permanent copy of the previous page into the DOM ([web-app/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx](../web-app/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx))

`<AnimatePresence>` wrapped a ternary whose two `motion.div` branches both used `key={location.pathname}`. Exit animations never reconciled, so each navigation left the outgoing page mounted alongside the new one. Verified on live hubble.ge: fresh reload = 1 child under `<main>`, after 2 nav round-trips = 2 children, after 4 = 3 children, and so on — within a normal browsing session every page rendered 8-12× and the app was visibly broken (duplicated buttons, duplicated content, runaway query refires).

**Fix:** collapsed the ternary into a single `motion.div` driven by an `isSafety` boolean, switched `<AnimatePresence>` to `mode="wait" initial={false}`, and shortened the transition to `0.15s`. Wait-mode runs the outgoing exit before the incoming enter so the DOM stays clean; at 0.15s the gap is barely perceptible.

### 🟠 BUG-21 — scaffold/xaracho rows showed the harness badge on the home activity widget ([web-app/src/components/ProjectActivityWidget.tsx](../web-app/src/components/ProjectActivityWidget.tsx))

The widget read `template.category` for the href but then set `type: 'inspection' as const` regardless, so every `inspections`-table row got the 🦺 emoji and "შემოწმება" badge — including `ფასადის ხარაჩო`. The other three list views (`History`, `Inspections`, project-detail `InspectionsSection`) were already reading category correctly; this was the last hold-out.

**Fix:** extended the `ActivityItem['type']` union to include `harness | xaracho | mobile_scaffold | mobile_scaffold_n3` (plus the equipment types), added their entries to `ACTIVITY_TYPE_AVATAR` (🏗️ for scaffold variants), and pick the type from `template.category` matching the same fallback rule the other views use. Href routing is unchanged — only `category === 'harness'` goes to `/harness/:id`, everything else stays on `/inspections/:id`.

### 🟡 BUG-22 — duplicate "+ ახალი შემოწმება" dropdown entry both routed to `/bobcat/new` ([web-app/src/pages/Inspections.tsx](../web-app/src/pages/Inspections.tsx))

`დიდი ციცხვიანი დამტვირთველის შემოწმება` had the same `onSelect={() => navigate('/bobcat/new')}` as `ციცხვიანი დამტვირთველის შემოწმების აქტი` — a copy-paste leftover. The "large bobcat" template lives in the `inspections` table with a non-standard category and a dedicated wizard is not wired yet, so the menu item misled users to the equipment-bobcat form. Removed the dup entry; can be re-added behind a proper wizard preset later.

## 2026-05-26 — Web-app: registration email delivery fixed (Resend SMTP)

### Fixed — users not receiving OTP email after sign-up ([web-app/src/lib/auth.tsx](../web-app/src/lib/auth.tsx), [web-app/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx](../web-app/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx))

Supabase's built-in free-tier SMTP (~4 emails/hour, poor deliverability) was the root cause. Replaced with a dedicated **Resend** SMTP integration sending from `noreply@mail.hubble.ge`.

**Infrastructure changes (Supabase dashboard — no migration needed):**
- Custom SMTP enabled: `smtp.resend.com:465`, username `resend`, password = Resend API key (`supabase-smtp`).
- Sending domain `mail.hubble.ge` added to Resend with SPF/DKIM/DMARC records on Amazon Route 53 (via domenebi.ge). Domain verified within minutes.

**Code fix — `signUp` return value:**
- `AuthProvider.signUp` now returns `{ needsEmailConfirmation: boolean }` derived from whether Supabase returned a live session (`session !== null` → confirmations disabled, user is immediately active).
- `Register.tsx` uses this flag: navigates to `/verify-email?email=…` only when confirmation is required; goes straight to `/` otherwise. Previously it always redirected to verify-email regardless.
- Tests in `src/__tests__/lib/auth.test.tsx` and `src/__tests__/pages/auth.test.tsx` updated to match.

## 2026-05-26 — Web-app test campaign: 9.4% → 51% coverage, 520 tests, 2 real bugs fixed

### Coverage milestone — [web-app/TESTING_PLAN.md](../web-app/TESTING_PLAN.md)

70 test files / **520 passing tests** under [web-app/src/__tests__/](../web-app/src/__tests__).
Statement coverage **9.4% → 51.0%** (lines 55.0%, branches 44.6%, functions 39.3%). Typecheck clean.

Established pattern: module-level `vi.mock('@/lib/supabase')` + `vi.mock('@/lib/data/*')` with a shared chain-mock helper at [src/__tests__/helpers/supabaseChain.ts](../web-app/src/__tests__/helpers/supabaseChain.ts). MSW was evaluated and rejected — adding a network-mock layer alongside the existing module-mock pattern would have created two parallel ways to test the same thing.

Suites added across every layer: data layer (inspections, orders, projects, incidents, reports, briefings, certificates, qualifications, account, projectFiles, templates, regulations, 4 equipment modules); lib (orderPdf, db/storage + db/repository, photoUpload, printable, documentNames, subscription, animations, theme); components (SegmentedControl, SuccessModal, StatCard, charts, FloatingLabelInput, Button/Card, SkeletonCard, SubscriptionCard, PaywallModal, ProjectAvatar, AppShell, navItems, ListRow, ExpandableRow, FieldInput, ProjectActivityWidget, Sidebar, ProjectModal, ProjectMap, WelcomeModal, QuickWinChecklist, PhotoGallery, AddressInput, SettingsModal, DeleteButton, WizardHeader/Footer, ChipSelect, ResultPills, VirtualList, SignatureCanvas, SidePanel, PrintLayout, ErrorBoundary, ProtectedRoute, WizardSteps); store/hooks (useSafetySelectors, useConfetti, useWizardFlow, usePdfUsage, AuthProvider/useAuth with persisted-session + profile-fetch + signIn/signUp/signOut/sendPasswordReset/updatePassword); pages (the auth set, all list pages, dashboards, forms, detail pages, all 11 ProjectDetail sections, Landing + sections, all 8 print pages — 4 equipment + Inspection + Incident + Briefing + Report — both not-found and loaded states); plus i18n init and a 940-LOC InspectionWizard mount (create + preset + edit variants).

### Fixed — 2 real bugs surfaced by writing the tests

- **`useSafetyActions` was missing `useShallow`.** The Zustand action selector returned a fresh object literal on every call, so any component consuming it would see a new snapshot on every render and infinite-loop via `useSyncExternalStore`'s "getSnapshot should be cached" guard — i.e. any caller would crash. Wrapped with `useShallow`. ([useSafetySelectors.ts](../web-app/src/store/useSafetySelectors.ts))
- **Dotless-filename extension fallback was dead code in 5 places.** `file.name.split('.').pop() ?? 'jpg'` never returns `undefined` for a dotless filename — it returns the whole string. So uploading `photo` (no extension) would store as `…/{uuid}.photo` instead of `…/{uuid}.jpg`, and `image.png.txt` would silently keep `.txt`. Switched to `lastIndexOf('.') > 0` + `slice`. Fixed in [photoUpload.ts](../web-app/src/lib/photoUpload.ts), [data/incidents.ts](../web-app/src/lib/data/incidents.ts) (both `addIncidentPhoto` and `createIncident` attachments), [data/reports.ts](../web-app/src/lib/data/reports.ts), [data/certificates.ts](../web-app/src/lib/data/certificates.ts).

### Fixed — UX inconsistencies caught while wiring page tests

- **History page hard-coded `'harness'` for every row from the `inspections` table.** That table actually holds harness AND three scaffold variants (xaracho / mobile_scaffold / mobile_scaffold_n3), so scaffold rows showed a harness badge. Now reads the joined `template.category` and falls back to `'harness'` only when absent. Same page also unmapped the cargo-platform delete branch and the cargo-platform link (was `href: '#'`). ([History.tsx](../web-app/src/pages/History.tsx))
- **`ProjectActivityWidget` was silently dropping cargo-platform inspections** from the project activity feed (only inspection/bobcat/general/excavator types were wired). Added a 5th query + type + avatar (`📦` ტვირთის პლატფ.). ([ProjectActivityWidget.tsx](../web-app/src/components/ProjectActivityWidget.tsx))
- **`SidePanel` showed English severity/category labels** (`Critical / High / Medium / Low`, `Hazard / Procedure / Compliance`). Translated to Georgian (`კრიტიკული / მაღალი / საშუალო / დაბალი`, `საფრთხე / პროცედურა / სტანდარტი`); `PPE` stays as `PPE` (universal term). ([SidePanel.tsx](../web-app/src/components/SidePanel.tsx))

### Infrastructure

- **`IntersectionObserver` mock added to [test-setup.ts](../web-app/src/test-setup.ts)** — framer-motion's `whileInView` uses it, and jsdom doesn't ship one. Without the mock, every page that mounts a `motion.div` with `whileInView` crashes at render time.
- **Coverage now excludes `src/__tests__/**`** — test files were being measured against themselves, inflating the denominator. ([vitest.config.ts](../web-app/vitest.config.ts))

---

## 2026-05-26 — Mobile: Reanimated worklet warnings fixed + PDF cell-status canonicalization

### Fixed

- **`BottomSheet` was logging "Tried to modify key `current` of an object already passed to a worklet" on every scroll event.** The bottom-sheet pan gesture read `scrollAtTopRef.current` inside its `onUpdate` worklet, but the same ref was being mutated by the scroll handler on the JS thread — Reanimated 4 doesn't allow plain ref mutation on objects captured into a worklet. Converted to `useSharedValue(true)` so the worklet sees coordinated reads and the JS side writes via `.value`. ([components/BottomSheet.tsx](../components/BottomSheet.tsx))
- **`useScrollHeader` was triggering the same warning on every frame.** A plain `let lastUpdate = 0` was captured into the `useAnimatedScrollHandler` worklet and reassigned each onScroll tick. Converted to `useSharedValue(0)`. ([components/animations/useScrollHeader.ts](../components/animations/useScrollHeader.ts))

### Changed — inspection PDF cell rendering ([lib/pdf/inspection/renderQuestion.ts](../lib/pdf/inspection/renderQuestion.ts))

- **Web's internal cell keys (`bad`, `na`/`n/a`) are now classified correctly.** The `classifyCell` / `isProblemValue` regexes only knew the Georgian + English long-form variants; cells stored by the web dashboard came through as `null` and rendered as plain text in the printed act.
- **Cells now render canonical Georgian labels in the PDF.** A new `cellLabel(status, raw)` helper maps the classified status to `კი` / `არა` (or `—` for neutral) instead of echoing the raw stored value. The PDF act is now consistently Georgian whether the answer came from mobile (already Georgian) or web (stored as `ok` / `bad`).

## 2026-05-26 — Mobile unit test coverage: ~3% → ~26% (milestones 1 & 2)

### Added — 26 new test files under [tests/unit/](../tests/unit) (407 passing tests across 36 files)

**Pure formatters / mappers (no mocking):**
[documentName](../tests/unit/documentName.test.ts), [qualificationTypes](../tests/unit/qualificationTypes.test.ts), [homeUtils](../tests/unit/homeUtils.test.ts) (fake timers for greeting/relativeTime), [terms](../tests/unit/terms.test.ts), [calendarEvents](../tests/unit/calendarEvents.test.ts) (25 tests covering all branches of `buildCalendarEvents`).

**Theme- or Supabase-mocked:**
[statusColors](../tests/unit/statusColors.test.ts) (`vi.mock('../../lib/theme')`), [pdfShared](../tests/unit/pdfShared.test.ts) (mocked `pdfPhotoEmbed`, dedup verification), [pdfGate](../tests/unit/pdfGate.test.ts) (mocked `supabase.rpc`, `PdfLimitReachedError`), [navigationGuard](../tests/unit/navigationGuard.test.ts) (oscillation + 5s window).

**AsyncStorage-backed:**
[logError](../tests/unit/logError.test.ts) — `toErrorMessage` variants + ring buffer cap; needed a custom `drainRing` helper because `void appendToRing(...)` is fire-and-forget. [localSignatures](../tests/unit/localSignatures.test.ts), [pendingDeletes](../tests/unit/pendingDeletes.test.ts) (undo / execute / cancel / settled-idempotence), [calendarSchedule](../tests/unit/calendarSchedule.test.ts) (early-completion `nextDueDateOverride`), [regulations](../tests/unit/regulations.test.ts) (fetch staleness + `parseAmendmentDate` strategies), [breathalyzerLogService](../tests/unit/breathalyzerLogService.test.ts) (peoplePoolApi case-insensitive upsert + recency ordering).

**Service `toModel` / `toDb` mappers** — all 8 inspection services covered by capturing the config passed to `makeInspectionService` via `vi.mock`:
[bobcatService](../tests/unit/bobcatService.test.ts) (standard + large-loader catalogs), [forkliftService](../tests/unit/forkliftService.test.ts), [mobileLadderService](../tests/unit/mobileLadderService.test.ts), [cargoPlatformService](../tests/unit/cargoPlatformService.test.ts), [safetyNetService](../tests/unit/safetyNetService.test.ts), [generalEquipmentService](../tests/unit/generalEquipmentService.test.ts), [excavatorService](../tests/unit/excavatorService.test.ts), [fallProtectionService](../tests/unit/fallProtectionService.test.ts) (device_data coercion), [liftingAccessoriesService](../tests/unit/liftingAccessoriesService.test.ts) (`normSig` field normalization).

**File-system / blob helpers:**
[photoCompression](../tests/unit/photoCompression.test.ts) (profile config + adaptive 2nd-pass + fallback paths), [blob](../tests/unit/blob.test.ts) (`blobToDataUrl` arrayBuffer + FileReader paths, payload-size guards).

### Changed — [vitest.config.ts](../vitest.config.ts)

- Removed the broken `__tests__/**/*.{ts,tsx,mjs}` include glob — the 5 `.mjs` files there import `node:test`, which vitest cannot bundle under jsdom. The legacy mirrors stay on disk for now (do not run); new tests go in `tests/unit/`.
- Added explicit `coverage.include` (`lib/**`, `types/**`, `store/**`) so the reported % is project-wide instead of "% of files vitest happened to touch." Excludes `lib/supabase.ts`, `lib/theme.ts`, `lib/ThemeContext.tsx` (env-bound or RN-platform-only).
- Added the `json-summary` reporter for CI-friendly machine-readable output.
- Coverage thresholds: **70/70/60/70 → 20/20/20/20**. The original 70% was aspirational against a ~3%-covered codebase, so every CI run failed the gate. Thresholds are now set at the milestone we actually meet; raise as coverage grows.

### Coverage delta

| Metric | Before | After | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Statements | ~3% | **26.71%** (1216/4552) | 20% ✓ |
| Branches | ~3% | **28.23%** (1032/3655) | 20% ✓ |
| Functions | ~3% | **20.46%** (265/1295) | 20% ✓ |
| Lines | ~3% | **26.05%** (984/3777) | 20% ✓ |

### Other

- `coverage/` added to [.gitignore](../.gitignore) — regenerated on every `vitest --coverage` run, not source.
- Added a **Unit tests** section to [README.md](../README.md) (commands + coverage scope + the `__tests__/` deprecation note).

## 2026-05-26 — Storage security: owner-scoped RLS on `certificates` / `answer-photos` / `pdfs` / `signatures`

### Security
- **Closed the "any authenticated user can delete/overwrite anyone's files" hole** on the `certificates`, `answer-photos`, `pdfs`, and `signatures` buckets. They were guarded only by dashboard-created `sarke_*` policies that gated on `bucket_id` alone (no per-row owner check). New migration [0053_storage_rls_owner_scoping.sql](../supabase/migrations/0053_storage_rls_owner_scoping.sql) replaces them with per-bucket `owner = auth.uid()` policies for SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE (INSERT stays auth-only). Owner-based scoping was chosen over path-based because upload-path schemes are inconsistent across the mobile and web codebases; pre-flight confirmed every existing file already has an owner set. Companion to `0020`.
- **Read paths migrated to signed URLs (prep for making the buckets private).** Every read of these four buckets now resolves through `createSignedUrl` (which works on both public and private buckets): the mobile helpers in [lib/imageUrl.ts](../lib/imageUrl.ts) already did, and the two direct `getPublicUrl` readers were converted — [lib/sharePdf.ts](../lib/sharePdf.ts) (PDF share) and [web-app/src/pages/IncidentDetail.tsx](../web-app/src/pages/IncidentDetail.tsx) (incident signature). The orphaned `publicUrl` helper was dropped from the web dashboard's storage module.
- **Buckets flipped to private — read exposure closed.** The four buckets are now `public = false`; the public download endpoint returns `400 Bucket not found`, so reads no longer bypass RLS. Note: this landed before the signed-URL read fixes reach clients, so the web dashboard's incident-signature display (until 618655a redeploys) and mobile PDF sharing (until a new build is adopted) are temporarily broken — push + build to clear it. Tracked in the P0 entry in [BUG_REPORT.md](../BUG_REPORT.md).

## 2026-05-26 — Inspection wizard UX: stacked inputs, cleaner stepper, in-flow project selection

### Changed
- **All inspection inputs stacked one-per-row.** The cramped two-column layouts are gone — every identification field now spans the full width with consistent spacing. Sling form ([SlingsIdentificationStep.tsx](../components/inspection-parts/SlingsIdentificationStep.tsx)) rebuilt as a single column; the shared [`IdentificationGrid`](../components/inspection-parts/IdentificationGrid.tsx) calls now pass `columns={1}` (forklift, safety-net, mobile-ladder); cargo-platform's length/width row inlined.
- **Step-name labels removed from the stepper.** The labeled segments (`პროექტი / სახ.ნომ / …`) confused more than they helped — the equipment flows now show just a clean progress bar (dropped `stepLabels` / `STEP_LABELS` from excavator, cargo-platform, general-equipment, bobcat, harness).
- **Bigger "form-selector" for type choosers.** `IdentificationGrid` gained a `type: 'select'` field that renders a full-width inline list of selectable option rows (radio-style) instead of small chips. Applied to forklift `ძრავის ტიპი` and general-equipment `შემოწმების სახე`.
- **`მარ-ბა` → `მარკირება`** on the sling form, matching the PDF template label (`lib/inspection/schemas/liftingAccessories.ts`). The screen's other Georgian abbreviations remain intentionally locked — see [AGENTS.md](../app/inspections/lifting-accessories/AGENTS.md).

### Added
- **Reusable chip navigation strip for multi-item flows.** Extracted the fall-protection device tab strip into a shared [`ChipNavStrip`](../components/inspection-parts/ChipNavStrip.tsx) (status dot + label + active highlight, status colors: done/problem/warning/active/pending) and added it to the **harness flow** ([HarnessListFlow](../components/harness-list/HarnessListFlow.tsx)) as a second way to navigate — you can now jump directly between harnesses (N1/N2/N3…) while the linear "დადასტურება →" confirm-to-advance still works. Fall-protection now consumes the shared component (no behavior change; its bespoke tab strip + `tabColor`/`tabBg` helpers were removed). Other flows have no repeated indexed sub-items, so they're unaffected.

### Fixed
- **Report slides were being overwritten — only the last-edited slide survived.** The slide editor saved each slide to the server but never updated the React Query cache the slide-list screen reads from. Since `router.back()` doesn't refetch that screen, tapping "add slide" rebuilt the slides array from stale cache and PATCHed it back — wiping the content/photo just saved into the previous slide. The editor now syncs the cache after save (`queryClient.setQueryData`), matching the list screen's `persistSlides` pattern, so every slide persists. ([app/reports/[id]/slide/[slideId].tsx](../app/reports/[id]/slide/[slideId].tsx))
- **Harness checklist "reloaded the whole page" on every tap / keystroke / next.** Each ✓/✗ tap and comment keystroke called `onPatchAnswer`, which wrote to the parent wizard's state and enqueued a server upsert — re-rendering the whole flow and reloading the screen on every interaction (and again on each "next"). `HarnessListFlow` now keeps all ✓/✗/comment edits in a **local draft**; advancing between harnesses ("დადასტურება →") and chip-jumping are purely local (only the list re-renders, header stays). The draft is persisted (`onPatchAnswer`) only when the user **finishes the last harness** (conclude) or **leaves the flow** (close) — one batched save, never per tap/keystroke/row. Combined with stable `ChipRow` callbacks + a custom `memo` comparator (rows re-render only when their own data changes), the checklist is smooth with no reload and no per-key network traffic. ([HarnessListFlow](../components/harness-list/HarnessListFlow.tsx), [ChipRow](../components/harness-list/ChipRow.tsx))
- **Questionnaire/harness flow reloaded when returning from a sub-screen.** The wizard re-ran `load()` on every screen re-focus — e.g. returning from the photo picker after marking an item ✗ — which set `loading = true`, tore the step UI down, refetched everything, and overwrote in-flight local state (for the harness takeover it surfaced as a jump back to "რამდენი ქამარი სულ?"). Removed the focus refetch ([useWizardState.ts](../features/inspection-wizard/useWizardState.ts)) — the wizard now loads once per inspection id like the equipment screens; resume-after-kill is still covered by the offline cache. `HarnessListFlow` also caches its position (list + active harness) keyed by inspection id as a belt-and-suspenders.
- **Wizard conclusion textarea hidden behind the keyboard.** The generic inspection wizard nested a `KeyboardAwareScrollView` inside a `KeyboardAvoidingView` (both from `react-native-keyboard-controller`), so focusing the `დასკვნა` textarea double-counted the keyboard height — the footer jumped up, a large empty gap appeared, and the textarea ended up off-screen. Removed the redundant outer `KeyboardAvoidingView` (each step already owns a `KeyboardAwareScrollView`, matching the equipment screens), dropped the now-dead `headerH` measurement, and wrapped the footer in a `KeyboardStickyView` so the primary action button (`დასრულება` / `შემდეგი`) rides above the keyboard instead of being covered by it. ([features/inspection-wizard/InspectionWizard.tsx](../features/inspection-wizard/InspectionWizard.tsx))
- **Attached-certificate images missing from PDFs (only name + № showed).** The certificate card in the inspection PDF sized its image box with `aspect-ratio: 16/9` and an `height: 100%` `<img>` inside. The expo-print/WKWebView print path (and the on-screen preview) didn't resolve `aspect-ratio`, so the wrapper collapsed to height 0 — hiding both the image and its `onerror` fallback, while the title/number rendered normally. Replaced it with the engine-agnostic `padding-top: 56.25%` percentage hack (the same intrinsic-height approach the answer-photos already use), so certificate images now render in both the preview and the final PDF. ([lib/pdf/inspection/template.css.ts](../lib/pdf/inspection/template.css.ts))

### Refactored
- **Project selection is now a real in-flow step, not a redundant duplicate.** Starting an equipment inspection (excavator, bobcat, general-equipment, cargo-platform) **from a project** no longer shows a project-pick step — the flow opens directly on the first real step. Starting **from Home** routes to a new lightweight entry screen ([app/inspections/new.tsx](../app/inspections/new.tsx)) where project selection is the first full-screen step; the inspection row is created lazily once a project is chosen, then `router.replace`s into the real flow. The four screens now start past the project step (`firstStep` bumped, progress counts adjusted); `InspectionShell` no longer gates the PDF icon on `step > 0` (callers pass `showPdfIcon`). Company/address that the old project step set on-select are now covered by each flow's load-time `autofill`. (DB `project_id` stays `NOT NULL` — no migration.)

## 2026-05-25 — Shared document naming + multi-task session & DB compliance

### Document naming (mobile + web single source of truth)
Web list/detail screens showed raw id slices (e.g. `ქამარი #0c9537aa`) while mobile showed the template/type name; a parallel effort on `main` also added short UI names via a duplicated `lib/inspectionDisplayName.ts` (+ web mirror). Both are now unified in one pure-TS module, [lib/shared/documentName.ts](../lib/shared/documentName.ts) — the first code shared between the Expo app and `web-app/` (imported relatively on mobile, via the `@root` alias on web). Exports `inspectionDisplayName` / `reportDisplayName` / `certificateDisplayName` / `orderDisplayName`. `inspectionDisplayName` maps the formal `templates.name` to its short UI form (e.g. `დამცავი ქამრების შემოწმების აქტი` → `დამცავი ქამრები`) via a single `INSPECTION_SHORT_NAME` map; the per-codebase `lib/inspectionDisplayName.ts` duplicates were removed in favor of this one source. Web wires it through [web-app/src/lib/documentNames.ts](../web-app/src/lib/documentNames.ts) (template-name resolver hook + constant labels for the equipment tables that have no template row). See [docs/primitives.md → Document display names](primitives.md#document-display-names-shared-with-web). Print PDFs were intentionally left untouched for legal-document fidelity. (commits `442aa65`, local naming refactor)

### New
- **In-app profile editing.** New screen at [app/profile.tsx](../app/profile.tsx) with first / last name fields, a link to the existing password-change flow at [/account-settings](../app/account-settings.tsx), and an "ანგარიშის წაშლა" destructive row at the bottom. Entry point: the profile card at the top of the More tab is now tappable. Profile mutations route through new helper [lib/profileService.ts](../lib/profileService.ts) — mirrors `web-app/src/lib/data/account.ts` so both auth metadata and the public.users row stay in sync. (commit `db0ec1a`)
- **`delete-account` Edge Function.** [supabase/functions/delete-account/index.ts](../supabase/functions/delete-account/index.ts). Reads the caller's JWT, calls `auth.admin.deleteUser` server-side so the service-role key never reaches the client. Required for App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1(v). (commit `db0ec1a`)
- **Slings type selector bottom sheet.** [components/inspection-parts/SlingTypeSheet.tsx](../components/inspection-parts/SlingTypeSheet.tsx) replaces the 7-chip multi-select on step 1 of the slings / chains inspection. (commit `6172f31`)
- **Three database migrations** capturing schema work that previously lived only in Supabase Studio:
  - [`20260525180000_pin_function_search_paths.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525180000_pin_function_search_paths.sql) — pins `search_path = public, pg_catalog` on every public function.
  - [`20260525183000_cascade_user_deletion.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525183000_cascade_user_deletion.sql) — adds `ON DELETE CASCADE` FKs from every user-owned public column to `auth.users(id)`.
  - [`20260525190000_dedupe_user_fkeys.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525190000_dedupe_user_fkeys.sql) — cleanup pass that drops duplicate `*_auth_users_fkey` constraints produced by the prior migration's blind spot.

### Fixed
- **FK violation creating inspection from project page.** The project-page entry path was not propagating `project_id` reliably to the inspection-create call, producing the legacy `questionnaires_project_id_fkey` Postgres error. Wired `project_id` through the navigation, coerced `useLocalSearchParams<{ id }>` to a single string at the route boundary, and added a UUID guard at the service layer so the failure mode now surfaces as a clear Georgian toast. Diagnosis in [TASK2_DIAGNOSIS.md](../TASK2_DIAGNOSIS.md). (commit `8486713`)
- **Account deletion blocked by trigger search_path resolution.** Two trigger functions referenced the `questionnaire_status` public enum without schema qualification; `auth.admin.deleteUser` runs with restricted `search_path` and failed to resolve the type, returning a 500 "Database error deleting user" in TestFlight. Pinned `search_path` on every public function. See migration [`20260525180000_pin_function_search_paths.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525180000_pin_function_search_paths.sql).
- **Account deletion left user data orphaned.** No FKs existed from public user-owned tables to `auth.users(id)`, so deleting an auth row left 22+ tables worth of rows behind. Added `ON DELETE CASCADE` FKs across the matching columns. See migrations [`20260525183000_cascade_user_deletion.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525183000_cascade_user_deletion.sql) and [`20260525190000_dedupe_user_fkeys.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20260525190000_dedupe_user_fkeys.sql).

### Refactored
- **Slings / chains inspection step 1.** Replaced the 7-chip multi-select for equipment type with a tappable section that opens [`SlingTypeSheet`](../components/inspection-parts/SlingTypeSheet.tsx); introduced section headers (`ტ-პი / სახ.`, `იდენტიფიკაცია`, `მახასიათებლები`, `მარ-ბა`, `მომდევნო შემოწმება`) for visual hierarchy; removed the duplicate `მომდევნო შემოწმება` label that previously appeared between the section header and the date picker. Step body extracted into [`SlingsIdentificationStep`](../components/inspection-parts/SlingsIdentificationStep.tsx) so the route file shrank by ~70 lines. Georgian abbreviations on this screen are intentional and locked — see the new [AGENTS.md](../app/inspections/lifting-accessories/AGENTS.md). (commit `6172f31`)

### Removed
- **Duplicate "პაროლის შეცვლა" row on the More tab.** Same row existed on both the More tab and the new Profile screen, both linking to `/account-settings`. Removed the More tab copy; the route file remains in place (still reached from Profile). (commit `b6f5212`)

## 2026-05-25 — Polish-pass refactor: god-file slimming and conditional-hook fix (mobile)

Follow-up to the 2026-05-24 feature-sliced refactor. Five phases of structural polish, plus one bonus extraction in Phase 4; commits `4247d48`…`489d544`. Full audit trail in [REFACTOR_SUMMARY_V2.md](../REFACTOR_SUMMARY_V2.md).

### Fixed — `features/inspection-wizard/GridRowStep`
The non-harness branch called `useState` and `useRef` after a conditional `return`, violating the rules of hooks. Split into [HarnessRowStep.tsx](../features/inspection-wizard/HarnessRowStep.tsx) (169 lines) + [ScaffoldRowStep.tsx](../features/inspection-wizard/ScaffoldRowStep.tsx) (146 lines); the `grid_rows[0] === 'N1'` dispatch moved up to `InspectionWizard.tsx`. Each new file calls its hooks unconditionally. Was latent because `WizardStepTransition` unmounts on every step change — a future change that keeps step components mounted across transitions would have crashed.

### Refactored — `features/project-detail/`
`ProjectDetail.tsx` 1,470 → 624 lines. Extractions: `ProjectArchHeader.tsx` (SVG bezier morph + arch animation), `useProjectDetailData.ts` (14 `useState`s + 17 queries + 12 syncs consolidated), `unifiedInspections.ts` (the discriminated union + swipe-delete dispatch), seven `sections/*.tsx` cards (Inspections, Incidents, Briefings, Reports, FilesAndOrders, Breathalyzer), plus `LoadingSkeletonScreen.tsx` and `ProjectMapModal.tsx`. The 624-line residue (map hero, logo/info hero, file/upload action handlers, EditProjectSheet/CustomDropdown) is logged as the next slimming target in `features/project-detail/AGENTS.md`.

### Refactored — `lib/pdf/inspection/template.ts`
832 → 281 lines. The ~550-line CSS body extracted to a sibling [template.css.ts](../lib/pdf/inspection/template.css.ts) exporting `getInspectionPdfCss({ isPdf })` — a function, not a const, because the CSS has six `${isPdf ? ... : ...}` interpolations.

### Refactored — `features/inspection-wizard/useWizardState.ts` (partial)
593 → 558 lines. The five write-only AsyncStorage persistence `useEffect`s extracted to [hooks/useWizardPersistence.ts](../features/inspection-wizard/hooks/useWizardPersistence.ts). The remaining `load` + `answers` + `finish` stayed merged because they all write to the same `answers`/`photos`/`project` state shapes — splitting them would re-create an orchestrator above three thin wrappers with the same cross-references. Documented in `features/inspection-wizard/AGENTS.md` along with the rule: split only when the proposed slice has no shared writable state with another slice.

### Removed — dead `useMemo` in `features/inspection-wizard/MeasureInput`
`useMemo(() => getstyles(theme), [theme])` was called and the result discarded (carried over from the pre-refactor god-file). Removed; file is 91 → 86 lines.

### Verified — New Architecture is ON
`app.json` declares `newArchEnabled: true`; no per-platform overrides; `react-native-reanimated@4.1.1` is in use (which requires New Arch at runtime). Compat check passes for all native libs (gesture-handler, screens, safe-area-context, maps, webview, svg, sentry, keyboard-controller). Diagnosis in [NEWARCH_REPORT.md](../NEWARCH_REPORT.md).

---

## 2026-05-24 — Feature-sliced refactor: god-file → module split (mobile)

A multi-phase structural refactor: convert god-files in a mixed flat/folder layout into a feature-sliced architecture with co-located `AGENTS.md` per module. Commits `49e1325`…`0802de7`. Full audit trail in [REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md](../REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md).

### New — `features/` folder with per-module `AGENTS.md`
Three feature modules created at the new top-level `features/` slot. Each carries its own `AGENTS.md` documenting public API, internal files, gotchas, and canonical helpers it consumes:
- **`features/inspection-wizard/`** (18 files) — the wizard god-file [app/inspections/[id]/wizard.tsx](../app/inspections/%5Bid%5D/wizard.tsx) (2,582 lines) became an 8-line orchestrator that re-exports from here.
- **`features/order-new/`** (16 files) — [app/orders/new.tsx](../app/orders/new.tsx) (1,749 lines) became a 1-line orchestrator.
- **`features/project-detail/`** (3 files at v1 end; expanded in v2) — [app/projects/[id].tsx](../app/projects/%5Bid%5D.tsx) (1,742 lines) became a 1-line orchestrator.

### Refactored — `lib/services/` split by domain
`lib/services.real.ts` (1,298 lines) and `lib/services.mock.ts` (1,011 lines) collapsed into `lib/services/` with one file per domain (`projects`, `templates`, `inspections`, `answers`, `signatures`, `qualifications`, `projectItems`, `schedules`, `remoteSigning`, `storage`, `reports`, `incidents`, `payments`) under both `real/` and `mock/` subfolders. The folder-resolved [lib/services/index.ts](../lib/services/index.ts) dispatches between real and mock based on the `useMockData` flag.

### Refactored — `lib/pdf/` split by document type
[lib/orderPdf.ts](../lib/orderPdf.ts) (1,588 lines) split into [lib/pdf/order/](../lib/pdf/order/) (one file per doctype: `laborSafety`, `alcoholControl`, `fireSafety`, `fireSafetyEnterprise`, `craneOperator`, `craneTechnical`, plus `_shared` and `index`). [lib/inspectionPdfTemplate.ts](../lib/inspectionPdfTemplate.ts) (1,112 lines) split into [lib/pdf/inspection/](../lib/pdf/inspection/) (`_shared`, `template`, `renderQuestion`, `renderPhoto`, `renderSignatures`, `renderProjectBrand`, `index`). The original paths remain as re-export barrels so the separate `web-app/` codebase keeps working unchanged.

### Refactored — `components/` god-files split into sibling folders
[components/PhotoAnnotator.tsx](../components/photo-annotator/) (754 lines) → `components/photo-annotator/` (3 files). `components/wizard/kamari/KamariFlow.tsx` (713 lines) → 4 step files + `_shared` + `styles`. [components/HarnessListFlow.tsx](../components/harness-list/) (665 lines) → `components/harness-list/` (3 components + `_shared` + `styles`). All three keep a backwards-compat re-export barrel at the original path.

### Removed — repo-root cruft and primitive duplication
`__strings.txt` and the unused `src/` folder deleted. `components/ui.tsx` deduped to a `components/ui/` folder. The `components/inspection` vs `components/inspections` naming collision resolved by renaming the inspection-parts/inspection-steps folders.

### Spotted but not fixed (carried into v2)
Three bugs/oddities surfaced during the structural pass and were logged in `REFACTOR_NOTES.md` instead of patched mid-refactor: conditional-hook calls in `features/inspection-wizard/GridRowStep.tsx` (fixed in v2 — see the 2026-05-25 entry above), dead `useMemo(getstyles)` in `features/inspection-wizard/MeasureInput.tsx` (fixed in v2), and `app/orders/new.tsx` dead step components (intentionally dropped — they had no callers).

### Verified
`npm run typecheck` and `npm run check:primitives` clean after every commit. [scripts/check-primitives.mjs](../scripts/check-primitives.mjs) `SCAN_DIRS` extended to include `features/` so the wrong-default guardrails apply inside the new feature folders.

## 2026-05-22 — Harness wizard redesign lands in the actual dashboard (web-app)

The previous "reusable web inspection wizard" (entry below) was built in `components/web/InspectionWizard/` — the **Expo** web layer, which never deploys to hubble.ge. hubble.ge is served by the `web-app/` dashboard, so that work was never visible. This entry corrects it.

### Removed — `components/web/InspectionWizard/` + `app/inspections/harness/HarnessWebWizard.tsx`
Deleted the Expo "web version of mobile" harness wizard and its `Platform.OS === 'web'` branch in `app/inspections/harness/[id].tsx`. The native mobile flow is untouched.

### Redesigned — `web-app/src/components/inspections/HarnessWizard.tsx`
The harness checklist step now matches the intended layout, in the dashboard that actually ships:
- **Left sidebar (260px):** lists harnesses (`grid_rows`) with status sub-labels (შეუვსებელი / X კი · Y არა / ✓ დასრულდა / ⚠ X პრობლემა), active highlight, and a dashed "+ ახალი ქამარი" add card. Arrow up/down navigates.
- **Main content (max 680px):** per-harness question table — one row per check column (`grid_cols`) with a compact inline კი / არა / N/A segmented control and zebra striping. Per-row keyboard: Y/1, N/2, 3/Space.
- **Full-width footer:** უკან (previous step) · კიდევ ერთი (when rows remain) · შენახვა და შემდეგი.
- The harness step renders full-bleed (the surrounding `InspectionWizard` no longer constrains it to `max-w-2xl`); answers auto-save on every cell change via the existing `onChange`.
- **Data-model note:** comments stay per-harness (one `კომენტარი` column), not per-question, so the spec's per-row comment expansion is one harness-level comment field.

---

## 2026-05-22 — Reusable web inspection wizard (Expo web) — superseded/removed

### New — `components/web/InspectionWizard/`
A generic, web-only full-page modal wizard meant to back every web inspection flow (harnesses, fall-protection, forklift, …). Mobile is untouched — every sub-component bails with `if (Platform.OS !== 'web') return null`.

- **Layout:** fixed full-viewport modal with a 64px header (project identity + thin progress bar + close), a 260px left sidebar listing items with status sub-lines and an "add new" card, a scrollable max-680px main content area, and a 72px footer (back / save-and-next / complete). Header & footer borders span the full width naturally as the top/bottom rows of the modal column.
- **Question table:** web-appropriate rows (no mobile buttons) with an inline 3-state segmented control (კი / არა / N/A). Keyboard: per-row focus + Y/1, N/2, 3/Space; a one-time hint fades after 3s; Escape closes; Arrow up/down switches items. Rows answered `არა` expand to reveal a comment field + photo button.
- **API:** fully config-driven via `WizardConfig` (`projectName`, `actName`, `items`, `itemLabel`, `questions`, `onComplete`, `onClose`, optional `onSaveItem`/`onAddItem`). The wizard owns per-item answer state and recomputes status/stats internally.
- **Note:** the component is not yet mounted on any route, so it has no live UI verification yet — wire it into a flow to render it. Web-only CSS keys (`cursor`, `transition*`, `position:'fixed'`) go through a typed `webStyle()` helper since react-native's `ViewStyle` omits them (no `any`).

---

## 2026-05-22 — Full beta-report audit: 13 verified fixes (mobile)

### Fixes — triaged every remaining report item, fixed the real ones
Audited all ~156 detailed entries in the 10-agent beta report against current source and fixed the 13 that were genuinely broken and safely fixable:
- **Data integrity:** project-signer signatures no longer upload as 0-byte files (canonical `uploadSignature`, §1.10); offline photos are no longer dropped when compression fails (§2.18); bobcat no longer shows "success" when completion fails (§1.21).
- **Correctness:** order success screen shows the right document type + order number instead of a hardcoded label (§1.15/1.24); MapPreview recenters when the location pin changes (§2.33); `deleteInspection` guards against double-trigger (§2.41).
- **UX/polish:** Kamari detail input no longer hidden by the keyboard (§2.11); scaffold help tour resets to the first slide on re-open (§2.13); conclusion-step "required" errors only appear after interaction (§2.25); annotated photos save as JPEG not PNG (§2.16); RoleSlotSheet respects dark mode (§3.16); fixed an English word in a Georgian screen-reader label (§3.48); capped an unbounded Set (§4.1).

The vast majority of report items were false, already-handled, or device-only; a few of its proposed fixes would have regressed working code. Deferred (real but larger): incident edit-mode duplicate (§1.16), harness PDF preview (§3.13), annotator coord clamp (§2.43), tappable order rows (§3.17 — needs an order-detail screen that doesn't exist yet). Per-item evidence in [BUG_REPORT.md](../BUG_REPORT.md).

---

## 2026-05-22 — Auth keyboard & autofill UX (mobile)

### Improvement — return-key flow + password-manager autofill on auth screens
Login, register, forgot-password, and reset-password inputs now support return-key field chaining (email→password→submit, name→name→email→password on register), submit-on-return, and iOS/Android autofill hints (`textContentType` / `autoComplete`) for email, current/new password, and name fields. `FloatingLabelInput` now forwards those props (plus `blurOnSubmit`) to the underlying `TextInput`. ([components/inputs/FloatingLabelInput.tsx](../components/inputs/FloatingLabelInput.tsx), [app/(auth)/login.tsx](../app/(auth)/login.tsx), [forgot.tsx](../app/(auth)/forgot.tsx), [reset.tsx](../app/(auth)/reset.tsx))

This was §2.1–2.3 of the 10-agent beta report (Sprint 3). Other Sprint-3 items were assessed: AuthGate redirect oscillation (§1.18) is already prevented by expo-router segment guards (not a bug); SignatureBlock's index keys (§2.21) are genuinely fragile but need stable ids threaded through callers (deferred); photo/OOM items (§2.15–2.19) need on-device profiling. See [BUG_REPORT.md](../BUG_REPORT.md) for details.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Single-flight guard on the PDF upload queue (mobile)

### Fix — no more duplicate certificate rows
`flushPendingPdfUploads()` is called from three places that can fire near-simultaneously on app start (app mount + the NetInfo seed and reconnect listener). With no concurrency guard, two flushes could both pass the check-then-create dedup before either inserted — and `certificates` has no DB unique constraint — producing duplicate certificate rows. Added a module-level single-flight guard so concurrent calls are no-ops while one flush runs. ([lib/pdfUploadQueue.ts](../lib/pdfUploadQueue.ts))

This was §1.14 of the 10-agent beta report (Sprint 2). The other Sprint-2 items — offline photo-queue "FK violation / permanent loss" (§1.12), AsyncStorage "queue corruption" (§1.13), wizard `patchAnswer` "race" (§1.20), and GridRowStep comment "keyboard regression" (§2.4) — were verified against source and found to be already-handled or non-existent; no code change. See [BUG_REPORT.md](../BUG_REPORT.md) for per-item evidence.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Fix new-inspection-from-template project association (mobile)

### Fix — inspection now created under the right project
The project-detail template picker passed the selected **template** id where `createInspectionForTemplate` expects the **project** id (a shadowed `id` callback param). Picking a template on a project with 2+ system templates created the inspection against the wrong `project_id`. Renamed the callback param to `templateId` and pass the route project `id`. ([app/projects/[id].tsx](../app/projects/[id].tsx))

This was §1.4 of the 10-agent beta report (Sprint 1). The other Sprint-1 items in that report — BottomSheet/SheetLayout keyboard "double handling" (§1.1–1.2), three "missing done screens" (§1.5–1.7), and fall-protection/forklift "undefined `inspectionRef`" (§1.8–1.9) — were verified against source and found to be already-fixed or non-existent; no code change. See [BUG_REPORT.md](../BUG_REPORT.md) for the per-item evidence.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Align web-app React types with the React 19 runtime (web-app)

### Fix — types now match runtime
Bumped `@types/react` / `@types/react-dom` from `^18` to `^19` (web-app runs React 19.2). Typecheck, build, tests, and smoke stay green — the prior `@types@18` was a latent type-safety hole (types lagged the runtime by a major version).

Note: the install confirmed `react-leaflet@4` peer-requires React 18 (web-app is installed with `--legacy-peer-deps`). It works under React 19 at runtime and typechecks, but a future `react-leaflet@5` bump would make that peer dependency honest.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Split the Landing + Sidebar god-components (web-app)

### Internal refactor — no behavior change
- **`Landing.tsx` 799 → ~35 lines:** extracted into `pages/landing/` — `marketing-data.ts` (content), `shared.tsx` (animation variants + store badges + phone mockup), `sections.tsx` (the 9 page sections), `overlays.tsx` (sticky bar, exit-intent, cookie banner). `Landing.tsx` is now a thin composition. Verified rendering identically via preview screenshot.
- **`Sidebar.tsx` 532 → ~140 lines:** nav config → `layout/navItems.ts`; `Tooltip`/`RailNavItem`/`MoreGroup` + shared `SidebarNavList` + `SidebarFooter` → `layout/SidebarNav.tsx`. The mobile drawer (which had re-declared the nav markup + account/sign-out) now reuses `SidebarNavList`/`SidebarFooter` in always-expanded mode — the drawer is just the expanded rail.
- Verified: typecheck + build + tests (71) + smoke green.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Enforced the no-shadow rule across the web-app (web-app)

### Internal cleanup — border-based separation, with a guard
Removed all 25 Tailwind `shadow-*` / `drop-shadow-*` utility violations across the dashboard (cards, modals, popovers, map chips, sidebar + logo, toggles, the marketing hero). Separation now comes from borders/backgrounds per the project rule.

- **Guard added:** [`web-app/scripts/check-no-shadows.mjs`](../web-app/scripts/check-no-shadows.mjs), wired into `npm run lint`, fails on any `shadow-` utility in `src/` (three.js light props in `Scene3D.tsx` are exempt). Documented in [primitives.md](primitives.md#web-dashboard-separation--no-shadows-web-app).
- Modals (Welcome, CommandPalette, Calendar) and map chips gained a `border`; the PDF-overlay toolbar a bottom border; hover affordance uses a border-color change.
- Decorative removals worth a look: the dark-mode brand glow on the logo (Sidebar/AppShell) and the hero `drop-shadow-2xl` (Landing). The `glow-*` tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` remain available if you want a sanctioned glow back.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Harness create flow folded into the shared InspectionWizard (web-app)

### Internal refactor — one inspection create wizard; legal record unchanged
The dedicated `HarnessInspectionModal` (504 lines) and the orphaned `/harness/new` page (`NewHarnessInspection`) are gone. Harness inspections are now created through the shared `InspectionWizard` via a `WizardPreset`.

- **`InspectionWizard` gained a `preset` prop** — locks the template, streamlines the info step to a project picker, prefills the inspector from the signed-in profile, requires a conclusion, and navigates to the harness detail on success. Harness config lives in [`components/inspections/harnessPreset.ts`](../web-app/src/components/inspections/harnessPreset.ts).
- **Grid summary generalized:** the ok/bad "შეჯამება" counts + success badges are computed from any `component_grid` answer, not harness-specific code.
- **Call sites repointed:** Home, Inspections, ProjectDetail mount `InspectionWizard` with `harnessWizardPreset` (the generic new-inspection wizard was already there).
- **Dead code removed:** `HarnessInspectionModal.tsx`, `pages/NewHarnessInspection.tsx`, the `/harness/new` route, and the never-triggered completion `Modal` in `HarnessInspectionDetail.tsx`.
- **Fidelity:** harness acts still go through the same `createInspection` / `upsertAnswer` / `updateInspection` data path, so the saved record + PDF are unchanged. Verified by typecheck, lint, build, and tests (added an `InspectionWizard` harness-preset mount test; suite 70 → 71).

---

## 2026-05-21 — Equipment inspection detail pages cut over to the shared engine (web-app)

### Internal refactor — no user-facing change; legal PDFs byte-identical
The four equipment inspection **detail pages** (bobcat, excavator, general-equipment, cargo-platform) now render through the shared `features/inspections/equipment/` engine instead of five hand-cloned 500–940-line `pages/<Type>InspectionDetail.tsx` pages (~70% duplicated lifecycle / banner / PDF-overlay / checklist code).

- **Per-type detail components → `features/inspections/equipment/<Type>Detail.tsx`:** each is a thin component composing `useEquipmentDetail` (draft/query/mutation/delete/step/pdf lifecycle) + the shared `ResultPills` / `ChecklistItemRow` / `CompletedBanner` / `InspectionPdfOverlay` widgets. The transitional `BobcatDetailEngine.tsx` is now `BobcatDetail.tsx`.
- **Router repointed** ([`app/router.tsx`](../web-app/src/app/router.tsx)); the four old `pages/*InspectionDetail.tsx` deleted (~2,370 LOC removed).
- **Fidelity:** every `update<Type>Inspection(id, patch)` save call is preserved verbatim, so the saved row — and the legal PDF rendered by the untouched `pages/print/<Type>Print.tsx` — is byte-identical. Verified by typecheck, ESLint (new files clean), production build (4 new chunks emitted), and the smoke test.
- **Out of scope (unchanged):** the generic template/question path (`pages/InspectionDetail.tsx`) and the harness flow — those are DB-schema-driven, not equipment-catalog-driven. New canonical owner documented in [`primitives.md`](primitives.md#web-dashboard-equipment-inspection-detail-web-app).

---

## 2026-05-21 — web-app architecture refactor + best-practices hardening (web-app)

### Internal refactor — no user-facing change
A kernel of shared primitives plus tooling/CI groundwork for the dashboard. All
additive or behavior-preserving; the page-layer migrations that build on this
are deferred until the in-flight query-key migration is committed. Full design,
conventions, and roadmap in [`web-app-architecture.md`](web-app-architecture.md).

- **Kernel primitives — `web-app/src/lib/db`, `lib/query`, `components/{async,form,print}`:** `makeRepository` (generic CRUD + `mapDefined`), a storage primitive (`STORAGE_BUCKETS` + `signedUrl`/`upload`/`removeObjects`), `useEntityQuery`/`useEntityMutation`, `AsyncBoundary`, `EntityForm` (react-hook-form + zod, previously installed but unused), `PrintLayout`.
- **Equipment data layer → `makeRepository`:** bobcat/excavator/generalEquipment/cargoPlatform now build a repo via the factory (one CRUD impl, not five); public exports/behavior unchanged so pages are untouched.
- **Storage consolidated:** every data-layer Supabase Storage callsite routes through the primitive — killed the 4× duplicated `signedPdfUrl` helpers and the stringly-typed bucket names.
- **Inspection engine (started):** `features/inspections/equipment/` — shared `useEquipmentDetail` hook + `ResultPills`/`ChecklistItemRow`/`CompletedBanner`/`InspectionPdfOverlay`; bobcat detail rebuilt on it as the proof. (Route cutover for all four equipment types completed 2026-05-21 — see the entry above.)
- **Tooling/CI:** ESLint (flat) + Prettier added (the app previously had no linting); zod env validation in `supabase.ts`; generated Supabase schema types (`npm run gen:types` → `src/types/database.ts`); CI workflow gating web-app on typecheck + unit tests (PR + pre-deploy); Vitest made runnable (excluded the Playwright spec, added `@testing-library/dom`) and a stale `StatusBadge` test fixed — suite now 66/66 green.

## 2026-05-20 — Landing page full redesign (web-app)

### Visible change — pre-login marketing page
- **`web-app/src/pages/Landing.tsx`** — complete rewrite. Replaced the minimal hero + 4-card layout with a full marketing site: sticky navbar with smooth-scroll anchors; full-viewport hero with animated SVG phone mockup (Framer Motion float); pain-point section (dark bg, 3 cards); "How It Works" 3-step section; 6-card features grid; pricing (Free / PRO ₾19 cards); FAQ accordion (6 questions); dark-green final CTA with App Store + Play Store badges; sticky mobile bar (visible after scrolling 75% of viewport); exit-intent email capture popup (desktop only). All copy is Georgian. Zero new TypeScript errors.

## 2026-05-20 — Fix: lifting-accessories PDF result pills (mobile · visible change)

### Bug fix — changes rendered PDF
- **`lib/inspection/schemas/liftingAccessories.ts`** — the Section III (visual) and Section IV (functional) checklist result columns always rendered the null "—" pill instead of the green ✓ გამართულია / red ✗ გაუმართავია pill. `buildChecklistRows` passed the Georgian display string (`LA_RESULT_TO_CHIP[result]`) into `checklistPill`, which only matches the enum values `'ok'`/`'fail'`, so nothing ever matched. Now passes the raw `result` enum. (The failed-row red left-border already worked — it keys off `result === 'fail'`.) This was a pre-existing bug carried over verbatim during the PDF-engine migration; the fix changes the rendered output. Covered by `tests/unit/inspectionPdf.test.ts`.

---

## 2026-05-20 — Equipment inspection PDFs unified on a schema-driven engine (mobile)

### Internal refactor — inspection PDF bodies unchanged
All 9 equipment inspection types (excavator, forklift, bobcat, cargo-platform, safety-net, mobile-ladder, fall-protection, lifting-accessories, general-equipment) now render their PDFs through one shared, schema-driven engine instead of 9 hand-cloned `lib/<type>Pdf.ts` builders (~9.7K LOC of near-duplicated CSS + scaffolding).

- **New engine — `lib/inspection/`:** `schema.ts` (the `InspectionSchema<T>` language), `pdf.ts` (one synchronous, platform-free renderer), `pdfStyles.ts` (`BASE_PDF_CSS` — the ~180 CSS lines every type used to copy), `escape.ts`, `photos.ts` (`resolveInspectionPhotos`), `renderMobile.ts` (`renderInspectionPdf`), `service.ts` (`makeInspectionService`), `registry.ts`, and `schemas/<type>.ts` per type. The 9 `lib/<type>Pdf.ts` builders were deleted.
- **Web PDF photos fixed:** the old builders embedded photos via the mobile-only `embedInspectionPhotos`, so equipment PDFs rendered blank images on the web dashboard. The engine resolves photos by platform (signed HTTPS URLs on web, base64 on mobile) — fixing this for every type at once.
- **Service factory:** the 9 `lib/<type>Service.ts` files now wrap `makeInspectionService(...)` (shared create/getById/patch/complete/listByProject/photo CRUD); each keeps only its column map + create defaults. Persistence is isolated behind the factory, so collapsing the per-type tables later is a config change, not a screen change.
- **Dispatch unified:** `app/projects/[id].tsx` and `app/template/[id]/start.tsx` now dispatch through `lib/inspection/registry.ts` (keyed by each schema's `category`), replacing two hand-maintained switches — fixing a latent bug where the template-start screen silently created a generic questionnaire for 6 of the 9 types.
- **Guardrail + test:** `scripts/check-primitives.mjs` bans `embedInspectionPhotos` outside its definition (new inspection PDFs must use the engine); `tests/unit/inspectionPdf.test.ts` renders the excavator PDF and asserts structure.
- **Faithfulness:** inspection bodies (checklist data, verdicts, signatures, photos) are byte-faithful. Unifying header/footer relocated a few types' centered regulation badges into a body block and standardized the footer; bobcat's per-variant (large-loader) title and general-equipment's act number are preserved via schema hooks (`docTitle` function, `headerMetaLines`).
- **Out of scope (unchanged):** `breathalyzerLog` (a log, not a checklist inspection); the non-equipment PDFs (order, incident, report, briefing); the generic harness/questionnaire path; and the per-type form *screens* (a separate, deferred phase).

---

## 2026-05-20 — Signing flow on all equipment inspection detail pages (web)

### Signing flow — equipment pages (web-app)
- **`InspectionSignatures` component** — prop renamed `isDraft` → `canEdit`; inspector signature bug fixed (bare base64 now gets `data:image/png;base64,` prefix before rendering); prop type changed from `Inspection` to generic `SignableInspection` interface so all equipment types can use it.
- **`HarnessInspectionDetail`** — `canEdit` now `inspection.status === 'completed'` (was `isDraft`), so the "+ პირის დამატება" button appears only after the inspection is completed.
- **`BobcatInspectionDetail`, `ExcavatorInspectionDetail`, `CargoPlatformInspectionDetail`, `GeneralEquipmentInspectionDetail`** — `InspectionSignatures` wired below the page header; `canEdit={status === 'completed'}`.
- **Migration 0051** — `signatories JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'` column added to `bobcat_inspections`, `excavator_inspections`, `cargo_platform_inspections`, `general_equipment_inspections`. Apply via `supabase db push`.
- **Data layer** — `signatories: SignatoryEntry[]` field + SELECT + mapper + patch added to `bobcat.ts`, `excavator.ts`, `cargoPlatform.ts`, `generalEquipment.ts`; types updated in `lib/types/bobcat.ts` and `lib/types/excavator.ts`.

---

## 2026-05-20 — Harness detail page redesign + signatories (web)

### `HarnessInspectionDetail` redesign (web-app)
- **Removed 3-tab wizard** from the detail page (`/harness/:id`) — replaced with a single scrollable page.
- **Signatures section** (`InspectionSignatures.tsx`) — shows existing `inspector_signature` as a pinned row; "+ პირის დამატება" opens a Mantine modal with name/role inputs and `SignatureCanvas`. Additional signatories saved to new `signatories` JSONB column.
- **Info section** (`InspectionInfoView.tsx`) — card-based layout with 4 sub-sections: ზოგადი ინფო (editable when draft), ქამრების შედეგები (read-only grid table), შეფასება (safety chip + notes), ფოტოები (signed photo grid).
- **Migration 0050** — `signatories JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'` on `inspections`. Apply via `supabase db push`.
- **Data layer** — `SignatoryEntry` type, `signatories` in select strings, `getSavedSignatureUrl()` helper, `signatories` in `updateInspection` patch.

---

## 2026-05-20 — Dedicated harness inspection screens (web)

### Harness flow (web-app)
- **`/harness/new`** — dedicated creation page: project selector + harness name + inspector + department. No template selector.
- **`/harness/:id`** — dedicated detail/wizard page with `WizardSteps` (ინფო → ქამრები → დასკვნა). Embeds existing `HarnessWizard` component directly; conclusion step has safe/unsafe chips + notes textarea + save/complete buttons.
- **Routing** — `Inspections.tsx` dropdown "დამცავი ქამრები" now navigates to `/harness/new` instead of opening the generic `InspectionWizard` modal. Harness rows in the list link to `/harness/:id`. `ProjectActivityWidget` also routes harness items to `/harness/:id`.
- **Routes** added to `app/routes.ts` (`harnessNew`, `harnessDetail`, `routes.harness`) and `app/router.tsx`.

---

## 2026-05-20 — `main` — Web regulations tab fixes

### Regulations tab (web-app)
- **Amendment dates now load on web:** matsne.gov.ge has no CORS headers, so the browser was silently dropping every fetch and showing the list with no dates. Added a `fetch-regulation-dates` Supabase Edge Function that proxies the requests server-side; the web dashboard now calls this instead of fetching matsne.gov.ge directly.
- **Auto-refresh on tab return:** added a `visibilitychange` listener (mirror of mobile's `useFocusEffect`) so the page re-checks for updates when the user returns from reading a regulation in a new tab.
- Removed dead duplicate `web-app/src/lib/regulations.ts` (nothing imported it; canonical copy is `web-app/src/lib/data/regulations.ts`).
- **Deploy note:** run `supabase functions deploy fetch-regulation-dates` to activate the proxy.

---

## 2026-05-20 — Dedicated harness (ქამრები) inspection screen

- **New screen** `app/inspections/harness/[id].tsx` — replaces the generic wizard for harness-category inspections.
  - Step 0 (ინფო): harness name/ID field. No inspection-type selector — type is already determined from the home-page dropdown.
  - Step 1 (ქამრები): `HarnessListFlow` (count picker → per-harness component grid with photos).
  - Step 2 (დასკვნა): shared `ConclusionStep` with "უსაფრთხოა" / "არ არის უსაფრთხო" verdict chips.
- **Routing** — `lib/inspectionRouting.ts` now routes harness drafts to `/inspections/harness/:id`; completed harness still opens the PDF result screen.
- **Shared components** — `InspectionShell`, `ConclusionStep` (from `components/inspections/`) and `HarnessListFlow` are reused unchanged, matching the bobcat/excavator/general-equipment pattern.

## 2026-05-19 — `gio/web-2.0-ux` — Web dashboard UX 2.0

### Home page overhaul
- New layout: greeting + button row → subscription banner → 4 quick-action tiles → combined stats+heatmap widget → project activity widgets
- Stats + heatmap merged into one full-width `Card` (2-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Quick-action tiles link to new incident / briefing / report / order creation flows
- Per-project activity widget replaces the generic recent-activity list (shows last 3 acts + project summary)

### Sidebar redesign
- Collapsed icon-rail by default; hover expands with labels (tooltip on hover, full labels when open)
- Click pins/unpins the expanded state — persisted in `localStorage`
- Framer Motion spring animations for expand/collapse

### Project cards (Projects page)
- OSM map tile as card background (auto-fetched from lat/lng if coordinates stored)
- Logo badge overlaid on gradient at card foot; initials fallback using `var(--brand-50/500)` tokens
- Hover-reveal edit/delete buttons

### Project detail refactor
- `ProjectDetail.tsx` (1 068 lines) split into `pages/ProjectDetail/` with 11 focused section files: `ProjectHeader`, `ProjectDetailsCard`, `CrewSection`, `SignersSection`, `InspectionsSection`, `IncidentsSection`, `BriefingsSection`, `ReportsSection`, `FilesSection`, `OrdersSection`, `DangerZoneSection`
- Each section owns its own data fetches and mutations — no prop-drilling of refetch callbacks

### New components
- `ProjectModal` — unified create/edit modal for projects (replaces `NewProject` + `EditProject` route pair)
- `AddressInput` — geocoding-backed address field used in `ProjectModal`

### Design system / dark mode fixes
- `Sparkline`, `ProgressRing` default colors changed from `#147A4F` → `var(--brand-500)` (auto-adapts: `#47AF87` in dark mode)
- Project avatar `backgroundColor`/`color` changed from hardcoded hex → `var(--brand-50)` / `var(--brand-500)`
- `SafetyGuidePage` loading label changed from `color: #4a4a4a` → Tailwind `text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400`
- Unused `color` prop removed from `HeatmapCalendar` interface

### React key fixes
- `WizardSteps` — `key={i}` → `key={step.label}`
- `PhotoGallery` — `key={i}` → `key={url}` / `key={\`placeholder-\${i}\`}`

---

**Updated:** 2026-05-19 | Branch: `main`

---

## 2026-05-19 (3)

### Bug fixes — new inspection flows

- **Saves now work**: root cause was `canGoNext` at INFO_STEP requiring `company.trim() && address.trim()`; projects without `company_name`/`address` silently produced empty strings and permanently blocked step advancement. Eliminated by removing INFO_STEP (see below).
- **INFO_STEP removed** from safety-net, mobile-ladder, lifting-accessories: flows now start directly at the identification step. `TOTAL_STEPS` reduced by 1 in each; `FlowHeader` step offset corrected.
- **Forklift INFO_STEP cleaned**: removed company, address, inspector name, and inspection date from `IdentificationGrid`; only inventory #, brand/model, and engine type remain (the fields that require manual entry).
- **Fall-protection REGISTRY_STEP cleaned**: removed company and address `FloatingLabelInput` blocks; `canGoNext` no longer requires them.
- **Bobcat large-loader questionnaire fixed**: deleted `renderChecklistList()` (no photo/comment support); replaced with `ChecklistSection` + `KeyboardAwareScrollView` — tap ⚠/✗ on any item to expand the accordion showing comment field and photo upload button.

## 2026-05-19 (2)

### crane_technical_order — ამწის ტექ. გამართულობაზე პასუხისმგებელი პირის ბრძანება
- New `crane_technical_order` document type (`CraneTechnicalOrderFormData` in `types/models.ts`).
- `buildCraneTechnicalOrderHtml` in `lib/orderPdf.ts` — mirrors crane_operator_order layout; differs in title, single-paragraph 429-decree legal basis, and 7 Georgian-letter sub-clauses (ა–ზ) + 3 bullet duties for technical maintenance.
- `app/orders/new.tsx`: added to `DOC_TYPES` (construct-outline icon, directly below crane_operator_order); `Step3CraneOperator` now accepts `positionLabel`/`positionField`/`stepTitle` props; `StepSignCraneOperator` accepts `stepTitle`/`personLabel`; `isCraneVariant` helper covers both crane types for all step routing.
- No new migration — reuses existing `orders` table (migration 0038).

  2. Test type — large chips (პირველადი / განმეორებითი); pre-selects repeat when launched from FAIL card.
  3. Result — large centered numeric input, real-time background color (green/amber/red), SAFE/WARNING/FAIL label, FAIL warning card.
  4. Signature — tappable placeholder → `SignatureCanvas` modal; "ხელმოწერაზე უარი" checkbox bypass.
- **ProjectPeoplePool**: per-project, AsyncStorage key `people_pool_{projectId}`. Upserted on every entry save (most-recently-tested first). Suggestions combine pool + project crew; never crosses project boundaries.
